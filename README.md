# Habitable Planets from Kepler Data

This repository contains code to filter habitable planets from Kepler data. The code reads a CSV file containing data on exoplanets discovered by the Kepler spacecraft, applies filtering criteria, and identifies habitable planets based on certain criteria.

## Output

After running the code, the following habitable planets were found:

- Kepler-1652 b
- Kepler-1410 b
- Kepler-296 f
- Kepler-442 b
- Kepler-296 e
- Kepler-1649 b
- Kepler-62 f
- Kepler-452 b

8 habitable planets found!
